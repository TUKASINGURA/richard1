The code you provided is written in Python and simulates the transmit and receive process using a similar approach as the previous C implementation. It breaks the message into packets, shuffles the packets to simulate unordered transmission, and then receives and reconstructs the message.

Keep in mind that this Python code does not have full error handling or input validation like the C implementation. It assumes the input file exists and can be read successfully.
